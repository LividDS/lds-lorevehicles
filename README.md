**IF YOU DOWNLOADED THIS PACK BEFORE LAST COMMIT ON 9-9-2024, REDOWNLOAD NOW.**
Had some issues with publishing rights and rights for usage on FiveM servers. So to avoid trouble I highly recommend to take the resource out and redownload.

A large collection of high quality, lore friendly vehicles converted from GTA5-mods popular creators.

* 90 cars included.
* 29 having custom sounds.
* 75 of them having vehicle mod options for your customs script.

# Important ‚ö†Ô∏è
* Treat all vehicles in this pack as the following: *Modifying this package and it's contents except the text data such as handling, meta files and mod-kit, selling, paywalling or monetizing in any shape or form is prohibited.*
* All vehicles can not be used as donator cars and can not be exclusive to one person.

# Install üîß
1. Drag and drop `lds-lorevehicles` into your resources folder.
2. Remove `-main` from the end of the foldername.
3. Take `[lorevehicles-sounds]` and put it into the resources folder seperately.
4. Ensure `lds-lorevehicles` and `[lorevehicles-sounds]` in your `server.cfg`.
**NOTE:** Load `[lorevehicles-sounds]` BEFORE `lds-lorevehicles`.
5. You will need to add these to your `vehicles.lua` to your core resource in order to own them and sell them in your vehicleshops.

# Support üìû
* I will not offer support on any of these vehicles, everything on my part is in the README. If you want to change any handling files (which for some it's needed), you need to configure it yourself.
* The initial uploaded pack is all I will be providing, which are working in the state it's in your resources folder after having completed the installation above.

# Credits ‚ú®
* All credits to go the original creators of these vehicles. These vehicles may be removed from the pack if the owners will it.

# Contribute ‚ù§Ô∏è
* If you wish to contribute to this pack by adding vehicles or doing text data file changes, please make a PR. Make sure to link the vehicle from GTA5-mods and keep the original format of uploading.
* I will be checking before merching if it has been done correctly, which might take some time as I won't be checking this resource daily.
